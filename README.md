<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If you are a player, there's no installation instructions yet. If you are developer please check out the <a href=#installation>Installation</a> section.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you have Bepinex 6 installed as we need the IL2CPP support.
* [Bepinex 6](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)

### Installation

1. Install [Bepinex 6](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Yascob99/BluePrinceArchipelago.git
   ```
3. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project or check out <a href=#contributing>Contributing</a> if you want to help contribute instead.
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
4. If nuget fails to install the required nuget packages it's probably because you need to add a nuget feed for bepinex packages. Try running this command:
```dotnet nuget add source https://nuget.bepinex.dev/v3/index.json --name Bepinex```
5. If nuget didn't install the required dependencies and the previous step didn't fully fix the issue, you will need to run the following to install these packages by running these commands in the **project** folder.
    ```
    dotnet add package BepInEx.Unity.IL2CPP --version 6.0.0-be.755
    dotnet add package Archipelago.MultiClient.Net --version 6.7.1
    ```
6. Finally create a new file in the root of the repository and call it Directory.Build.props. Add this to the file replacing the directory "Path/To/BluePrinceHere/" with the path to your Blue Prince Installation:
```
<Project>
	<PropertyGroup>
		<BluePrinceDir>Path/To/BluePrinceHere/</BluePrinceDir>
	</PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Development Roadmap

- Rooms
    - [x] Ability to change initial draft pool and dynamically add back in rooms to the pool.
    - [x] Add ability to add extra copies of rooms to the pool
    - [ ] Add better handling of certain rooms that rely on other events to be added to the pool (eg. Morning Room)
    - [ ] Add ways of better handling upgraded rooms.
- Items
    - [ ] Create AP assets for replacement unique item locations
    - [ ] Handle recieving items mid-run and remove it from the appropriate inventories.
    - [ ] Handle Junk item rewards.
    - [ ] Handle Permanent items (rewards that persist between days).
- Reverse Engineering
    - [ ] Find events to hook to track if a run is ongoing so items and traps, and deathlinks can be applied at the proper times.
    - [ ] Find out how shops choose their inventory and how to change it based on our items.
        - [ ] Find out how to add checks that can be bought at a randomized price (for other players).
    - [ ] Look into how the trading post functions and how to handle replacing the tradeable items with AP versions when appropriate.
    - [ ] Find a place to hook for trunk goals.
- Goals
    - [ ] Find where to hook for specific goals being achieved.
- Archipelago
    - [ ] Create the logic for handling events from the AP server.
    - [ ] Create a reconnect logic that will reconstruct as much of the state as possible from the Data from the AP Server.
    - [ ] Create a way of storing run specific data in case of a game crash. (eg which save file, any queued checks, any temporary effects applied to the current day)
- UI
    - [ ] Create a better looking UI
    - [ ] Add a menu option for Archipelago Mode on creating a new file.
- Potential Long Term Goals
    - [ ] Check the ease of changing puzzles like the Mora Jai puzzles for use in future optional modes.
    - [ ] Add in the ability to swap in first enter room checks for a physical item hidden inside each room.
